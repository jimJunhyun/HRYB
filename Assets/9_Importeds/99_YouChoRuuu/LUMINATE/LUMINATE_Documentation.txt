==-------------------------= Setup =-------------------------==

- On your URP Settings Asset, set "Depth Bias" and "Normal Bias" to 0;
- On your URP Renderer Asset add the "Sky Renderer" renderer feature.
- On your URP Renderer Asset add the "Cloud Shadows" renderer feature.
- On your URP Renderer Asset add the "Fog Renderer" renderer feature.

Sky and Clouds:
- On any object in your scene, add the component "Render Sky".
- On any Volume in your scene, select "Add Override" and choose "GapperGames/Sky And Clouds".

Fog
- On any Volume in your scene, select "Add Override" and choose "GapperGames/Fog".

- Setup Complete :)

How to locate URP Settings/Renderer Asset:
1. Go to Edit/Project Settings/Graphics and select the 'Scriptable Render Pipeline 
Settings'. This is your URP Settings Asset
2. From your URP Settings Asset, select the first item in the 'Renderer List'. This is 
your URP Renderer Asset

==-----------------------------= Sky Renderer =----------------------------==


	Render Scale - The resolution that the sky renders at relative to the size of the screen.

	Blur Radius - The radius of the gaussian blur filter used to denoise/upscale the lower resolution sky.
	Blur Strength - The strength of the gaussian blur filter used to denoise/upscale the lower resolution sky.
	Blur Iterations - The iterations of the gaussian blur filter used to denoise/upscale the lower resolution sky.

	Alpha Step - Like Alpha Clipping but for the clouds. Will cut off clouds with a density below this threshold.
	Alpha Softness - Controls the smoothness of the alpha cutoff described previously.

	Sky/Cloud Brightness - Could do anything? Give it a try!

	Sun Size - I'll give you one guess as to what this does. :)
	Sun Size - See above.
	Star Size - See above.

	Light Wavelengths - The values used for the wavelengths of Red, Green and Blue light respectively in the Rayleigh Scattering Equation.
	Density Power - The density of the sky towards the horizon.
	Day scattering - The density of the sky during the day.
	Evening scattering - The density of the sky during the evening.

	Day Color, Evening Color - Remember, one guess!
	Saturation - Saturation of the sky colors.

	Quality - Controls the quality of the sky using the amount of steps and step size in the raymarcher. Higher quality means lower performance.
	Steps - The amount of steps the raymarcher uses. More steps means better quality but worse performance.
	Step Size - The size of the steps the raymarcher uses. Lower size means better quality but worse performance.

	Cloud Layer Low - The first type of clouds rendered in the sky.
	Cloud Layer High - The second type of clouds rendered in the sky.  

	Cloud Shadows - Deletes all files on your computer (it doesn't).  

	=---= To use custom clouds, create a CloudData asset by right clicking in the assets panel and selecting "Create/LUMINATE/New Cloud Data Asset" and assigning it 
		  to either the "Cloud Data Low" or "Cloud Data High" slots.

	=---= Warning: rendering clouds in "Cloud Layer High" with a lower altitude than the clouds in "Cloud Layer Low" will result in visual artefacts. =---=


==------------------------------= Cloud Data =-----------------------------==


	Noise Scale - The frequency of the noise used to detail the clouds. Higher values means more detail.
	Coverage Scale - The frequency of the noise used to shape the clouds. Higher values means smaller shapes.
	Invert Noise - I hope you haven't used your one guess yet!
	Noise Weights - Controls the weights of Low, Medium and High frequency noise respectively.

	Color - I hope you can guess this one...
	Day Brightness - Brightness of the clouds during the day.
	Evening Brightness - Brightness of the clouds during the evening.
	Day Min Darkness - Minimum Darkness of the clouds during the day.
	Evening Min Darkness - Based on those last ones, I'm sure you can figure this one out.

	Density - Density of the clouds, use lower values for lighter, fluffier clouds.
	Anisotropy - Controls convergence of light when facing the sun (silver lining).
	Scattering - How much light scatters through the clouds.
	
	Height Falloff - Vertical falloff of the density of the clouds.
	Thickness - Hmmmm, I wonder what this does.
	Speed - Makes you run faster? 
	Position - Position of the box the clouds are rendered inside.
	Bounds - Size of the box the clouds are rendered inside.

	Fog Density - Controls the clouds fading into the sky over distance.
	Fog Strength - Strength of the fog effect.


==-----------------------------= Fog Renderer =----------------------------==


	Quality - Controls the quality of the fog using the amount of steps and step size in the raymarcher and also the resolution of the fog. Higher quality means lower performance.
	Alpha Multiplier - Strength of the fog effect.
	Additional Lights Intensity Multiplier - Intensity of volumetrics created by additional lights.

	Fog Color - You already know what I'm going to say...
	Brightness - fhguhohaeyganyuoiyouiayiutbyuiayuitn
	Density - aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
	Min Density - THIS IS THE MINIMUM DENSITY OF THE FOG.
	Anisotropy - See Cloud Data section.
	Jitter - Applies randomness to the raymarching, which breaks up banding

	Blur Radius - See Sky Renderer Section.
	Blur Strength - See Sky Renderer Section.
	Blur Iterations - See Sky Renderer Section.
